Create Resource with id

## Challenge

- Add an `id` prop to `Pokemon`
  - Use `2` for Ivysaur to prove that it works
  - Take the `id` prop in `Pokemon`
  - Pass it to `read()`
  - Take id as an argument and use a template literal string to change to fetch pokemon
- Now, we've stolen a DOM attribute. Talk about that.

# Reference

This is where all features exist first before becoming ordered lessons.
Explore and pick up some ideas.

Here are a few things that don't have dedicated lessons yet:

- Use `react-router` hooks API for navigation
- Control Title with `useEffect` and `Context` â€” likely use `react-helmet` in production
- Style it all up
- `TypeBadge`
- `JSONI` to explore APIs in the view
- `NetworkController` "controller" component
- params hashing

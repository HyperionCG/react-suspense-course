# Lesson4

What's a Resource?
How does it talk with Suspense?

## CHALLENGE

- Define your own `createResource` function
  - Have it return an object
  - Give that object a `read()`
  - Make `read()` throw an `Error()`
  - Have `read()` throw a the unresolved promise
  - Have `read()` return content

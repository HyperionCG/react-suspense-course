# Avoid Too Many Spinners with SuspenseListâ€™s tail Prop

`tail` is an optional prop for `SuspenseList`.  
It works in tandem with `revealOrder` and has three options: `undefined`, `collapsed`, and `hidden`.

- `undefined`: show all `fallbacks`
- `hidden`: show no `fallbacks`
- `collapsed`: show only the next `fallback`
